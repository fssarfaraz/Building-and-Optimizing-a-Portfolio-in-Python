This Python notebook serves as a guide to constructing and enhancing investment portfolios. I will delve into two powerful optimization models: the Markowitz Mean-Variance Optimization Model and the Black-Litterman Allocation Model.

By leveraging these models, I aim to:

- Construct diversified portfolios : Reduce risk through effective asset allocation.
- Optimize risk-return trade-offs : Balance the pursuit of higher returns with acceptable risk levels.
- Incorporate investor views : Account for individual preferences and market insights.

To do this, we use the four tech giants Apple, AMD, Disney and Tesla as examples to build our portfolio.
